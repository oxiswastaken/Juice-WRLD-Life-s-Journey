Juice WRLD: Life's Journey is a pixel-style, side-scrolling runner inspired by the classic Chrome Dino game — but with a raw, emotional twist. Step into the shoes of Juice WRLD as he dodges pills, collects lifelines, and runs through a dark, symbolic world themed around his iconic Goodbye & Good Riddance era. With “End of the Road” playing in the background, the game captures the essence of Juice’s struggle, pain, and poetry — every jump a cry for help, every lifeline a flicker of hope.
